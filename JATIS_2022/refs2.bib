 abstract = {The aberrations of various types of curved constant-period
transmission gratings are discussed, using Fermat's
principle. We show that optimal performance is achieved
with a grating assembled from individual facets which form
a nonclosed surface. For this geometry, primary coma and
astigmatism are proportional to the facet size and, hence,
may be adapted to the angular resolution of a Wolter-type
telescope.},

@article{heilmann:11,
 abstract = {We report on measurements of the diffraction efficiency of
200-nm-period freestanding blazed transmission gratings for
wavelengths in the 0.96 to 19.4 nm range. These
critical-angle transmission (CAT) gratings achieve highly
efficient blazing over a broad band via total external
reflection off the sidewalls of smooth, tens of nanometer
thin ultrahigh aspect-ratio silicon grating bars and thus
combine the advantages of blazed x-ray reflection gratings
with those of more conventional x-ray transmission
gratings. Prototype gratings with maximum depths of 3.2 and
6 $\mu$m were investigated at two different blaze angles.
In these initial CAT gratings the grating bars are
monolithically connected to a cross support mesh that only
leaves less than half of the grating area unobstructed.
Because of our initial fabrication approach, the support
mesh bars feature a strongly trapezoidal cross section that
leads to varying CAT grating depths and partial absorption
of diffracted orders. While theory predicts broadband
absolute diffraction efficiencies as high as 60\% for ideal
CAT gratings without a support mesh, experimental results
show efficiencies in the range of $\sim$50--100\% of
theoretical predictions when taking the effects of the
support mesh into account. Future minimization of the
support mesh therefore promises broadband CAT grating
absolute diffraction efficiencies of 50\% or higher.},

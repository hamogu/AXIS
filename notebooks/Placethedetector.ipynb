Yet, a large fraction of the photons can in fact we detected with a shorter detector strip, which would reduce cost, mass, power requirements, and data rate at the expense of effective area. Many considerations contribute to the total effecttive area (the fraction of the aperture covered with gratings and if the gratings are coated are two important ones), but those do not change the shape of the blaze peak. So, we can study the impact that a shorter strip of detectors has on the effective area in general."

    "This plot shows the fraction of the dispersed photons that a detector array of a certain dimension will catch, normalized to an array with 300 mm - enough to include the far wings of the blaze peak. This plot does not account for details like the placement of chip gaps, but can be used to choose how many CCDs the AXIS detector for the dispsered signal should have. There are some bumps and non-linearities in the plot. Those come from the fact that at most wavelengths, more than one order contributes to the blaze peak (see plots above, e.g. at 20 Å order -5, -6, and -7 are significant). The positions of the orders change with wavelength according to the grating equation $n \\lambda = d \\sin \\theta$ where $n$ is the order, $\\lambda$ the wavelength, $d$ the grating constant and $\\theta$ the dispersion angle. For a single given wavelength, there are thus steps in the fraction of detected photons, where a large detector catches all three orders. For a slightly shorter detector, the fraction will drop as one order drops of the detectors, but then shortening the detector further will not have an impact on the fraction of photons detected, until it becomes so short that another order drops off and only one order fits on the detector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot avove averages those steps over a range of wavelengths (the legend in the plot), which leads to slightly smoother curves, but the blue curve still looks closer to the green than to the orange curve, which describes the wavelength range between the blue and green curve. Selecting a different input spectrum or changing the exact boundaries of the bands, moves those curves around a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the general trend is robust. We can see that a detector with a width of order 100 mm will only catch about 50-70% the photons. For scale, the CCD-ID 94's planned for Arcus are about 50 mm long, so this would be just 2 CCDs. There is little reason to use more than 4 CCDs of this type, because a 200 mm long detector covers essentially the entire blaze peak. (For comparison, Arcus uses 8 CCD-ID 94 detectors per camera. The Arcus gratings are only 4 μm deep and thus the blaze peak is wider.) Of couse, AXIS might choose a different detector type, but it should still plan to cover about 150-200 mm of length to catch most of the blaze peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Looking at this, I will baseline 4 CCD-ID 94 detectors. AXIS may adopt different detectors with different shapes, so the exact position of chip gaps etc. might change but I do have to put some assumptions in right now, just to get the simulations going.** In contrast, the direct imaging detector is currently simulated as a single square detector. In practice, we will want to use the same type of detector for both applications, but for the simulations at this stage, I just need some nominal layout so that images and 3D layout look realistic. "

    "# Ray-tracing the AXIS XGS\n",
    "\n",
    "In these pages I present the ray-trace studies I've done so far for the AXIS x-ray grating spectrometer (XGS). My goal is to explore different design options, but since some parameters of the mission are not fully defined yet, the exact numbers may change, but, based on my experience with . The top level results are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A spectral resolving power of $R = 3000$ is easy. We will reach that in any design studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For higher spectral resolving powers, the size of the flat gratings becomes the limiting factor, we have to use either smaller (and thus more) gratings, or bend or chirp them. With that, $R = 8000$ is possible. We choose $30*60$ mm$^2$ gratings as fiducial for most of these studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reaching an effective area of 1000 cm$^2$ at O VII requires the gratings to cover about 2/3 of the aperture. For $60*60$ mm$^2$ gratings, that requires about 360 gratings - fewer than Arcus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given that the PSF is not well-suited to sup-aperturing, the ideal aperturing scheme is **not** to opposite sectors, but just a gap in the negative dispersion direction (see 3D image below). \n",
    "\n",
    "- The blaze peak is relatively narrow. Detectors for the dispersed spectrum need to cover about 150-200 mm of length (half the size of a single Arcus camera). We simulate 4 CCDs of $25 * 50$ mm$^2$ for more of these simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pure Si gratings are essentially transparent above 2 keV. Even with the gratings inserted, the zeroth order still received 70% of the photons with would without gratings. The grating spectrum ranges from about 1.5-5 nm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coated gratings (we simulate Pt), extend the useful range of the gratings to about 2 keV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plots and more detailes can be found on the other pages of this website (see menu bar on top).\n",

I start with an interactive 3D view, which can be zoomed and rotated with the mouse in all supported browsers; pressing \"r\" returns the view to the initial position. See [the X3DOM documentation](https://www.x3dom.org/documentation/interaction/) for a full list of supported mouse and keyboard commands.\n",

    "Rays start in the aperture, which is shaped like a series of concentric rings. In the AXIS mirrors, photons will bounce twice in a Wolter-Schwarzschild geometry. However, in this simulation the mirror is simplified such that the reflection actually happens in a single plane (the the double reflection is taken into account when calculating the survival probability of a photon).

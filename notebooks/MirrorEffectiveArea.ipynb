    "The current instrument model contains a number of simplifications. The most important one is probably for the mirror itself. The mirror is modeled as plane onf infinitesimal thickeness. Each photon that intersects that plane is focussed perfectly in the focal point. There is no modelleing of individual mirror shells and no modelling of the double bounce in the WS geomtry. Instead, we simply add a Gaussian blur in in-plane and out-or-plane scattering that gives us a distribution of photon directions (and thus PSF) with the width that we expect the true PSF to have. The radius of the mirror modules is accurate (so the extend of the areas that needs to be covered with gratings is), but individual plates, thickness, etc and the support spider are not modelled. Thus the geometric opening area of the mirror is larger than it actually will be. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'm assuming a the mirror shells to be Ir coated and use the CXRO Henke tables for bulk iridium to calculate the reflection efficiency. Since I don't know the preliminary specifications for the AXIS cameras (at they are certainly subject to change), I base the filters and CCD QE on numbers that I've used in similar form for a number of other missions which I ray-traced in the past like Lynx, Arcus, and RedSox:\n",

    "- UV blocking filter: 30 nm Al + 45 nm polyimide\n",
    "- Filter support: Si mesh with 95 % open area (typical value for Luxel filters)\n",
    "- contamination on CCDs and filters: about 98% transmisivvity for all energies\n",
    "- CCD QE from Suzaku XIS1 BI CCD, assuming 42 micron depletion depth\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm assuming the same filters and efficiency for the zero-order detector and the dispersed signal. The exact shape of the affective area curve will depend on the numbers I have chosen here, but the assumptions are likely not widely off."

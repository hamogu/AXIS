Some of the scenarios use gratings at a high TRL, very similar to what have been demonstrated for Arcus already, while others explore modifications that seem plausible, but have not yet been demonstrated to the same level.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The fiducial scenario studied here uses $30 * 60$ mm$^2$ flat gratings, where all gratings have exactly the same grating constant. For reasons that will become clear below, they are arranged such that the short dimension is parallel to the dispersion direction and the long dimension to the cross-dispersion direction. \n",
    "- Using larger gratings means that fewer gratings are needed to cover the same geometric area with reduces cost and also losses due to geometric coverage by the grating support structure. A normal Si wafer can yield four $60 * 60$ mm$^2$ gratings, thus these can be manufactured at essentially the same cost as $30 * 60$ mm$^2$ gratings, but fewer gratings are needed.\n",
    "- When gratings are flat, they deviate from the Rowland torus. This can be compensated by varying the grating period over the grating (\"chirp\"). Chriped gratings allow us to use huge gratings ($60 * 180$ mm$^2$) without loss of resolving power. Chirped gratings have not yet been demonstrated.\n",
    "- Alternatively, the gratings can be bend in at least one dimesion to follow the Rowland-torus more closely. Laboratory tests of (smaller) bend gratings indicate that the bending does not impact their throughput.\n",

Only for the zeroth order do the imaging focus and the spectral focus agree and thus this order is circular as shown in the plot above. For CAT gratings, it is useful to use a *tilted* Rowland torus, which intersects the focal plane a second time, thus there is a second place (around 550 mm for the parameters chosen here) where the dispersed order is small in dispersion and cross-dispersion direction.

    "The left plot shows the arrangement of the grating facets looking from end of the mirrors towards the focal plane. The dispersion direction is from left to right and cross-dispersion from top to bottom. The distribution of facets can be improved to reduce the uncovered area in between, but that this stage it is not useful to spend to much detailed work on that. Note that the coloring scheme is different than in the 3D view on the interactive 3d website. Facets are colored according to the angle that the facet center has towards the positive dispersion direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot on the right shows a specific grating order on the detector (order 6). The detector is cylindrical following the Rowland circle. Intersection positions with this detector are the projected on the focal plane so that I can properly display them in a two-dimensional plot. Individual photons are colored according to the grating facet that they passed through. There are several things we can learn from this plot: First, note that the x and y axis are not to scale, this really is much longer in cross-dispersion direction (top to bottom) and narrow in the dispersion direction (left to right). Second, the absolute position along the dispersion direction is 53 cm from the focal point, so the dispersion angle is about 4 deg - significantly more than in Chandra or XMM-Newton. Thus, aberations that do not need to be considered for Chandra or XMM-Newton can be important here. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can now look at the distribution of colors and we see immediately that the distribution is not homogeneous. Photons that went through the cyan, green, and yellow colored gratings are distributed a narrower than the blue and red points. Thus, sub-aperturing *can* definitely increase the spectral resolving power. However, the pattern of the sub-aperturing is completely different than the \"normal\" pattern. Typically, sub-aperturing is done using only an area along the cross-dispersion direction (here the orange and light blue gratings). In contrast, here, we achieve the best spectral resolving power by using only gratings that are located along the forward dispersion direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might be a surprising result at first glance, but thinking back to the assumptions that went into this simulation, it might seem a little more sensible. We set up the PSF such that there is only a factor of two difference between in-plane and out-of-plane scatter. Now, recall that this order is located about 50 cm from the optical axis; at the same time the facets go from -60 cm (red and blue) to +60 cm (light green). There is a considerable path length difference between those photons. The light green facets are located essentially \"directly above\" the order, while the red/blue ones are 1.5 m to the side; so it should not come a a complete surprise that the abbrations differ between those two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, I show how much better the spectral resolving power can be for different opening angles of the subaperture. That angle measures the angle between the center of a facet and the positive horizontal axis (the gap in the left image above). *There is no second mirrored sector*. For example, a subaperture angle of 30 degrees includes the cyan and light green gratings, 90 deg included light blue, cyan, green, yellow, and orange, and only the full aperture (subaperture angle 180 deg) includes all gratings, even the dark red and dark blue ones."

    "This figure displays the same data differently: Photons are binned according to the position of the grating they passed through, and that distribution is shown along the dispersion axis, called the \"line spread function\" (LSF). The resolving power $R$ is given by the width of the photons' distribution; narrower peaks mean a better $R$. For all the scenarios, the photons passing through gratings located close to perpendicular to the dispersion direction (green line) have the sharpest peaks. The other lines differ from the green line in two ways: They are often wider and in some cases their peaks are shifted. The width of the distribution is due to the intrinsic mirror PSF and the fact that the gratings deviate from the Rowland torus. In our simulations, the gratings are placed such that the center of each grating matches the Rowland torus. Because of the tilt of the torus, gratings located in the range $60-90^\\circ$ are almost tangential to the torus surface and have the smallest average deviation and thus the sharpest LSF. Larger gratings have larger average deviations than smaller gratings and thus the green LSF in the $60\\;\\mathrm{mm}\\times 30\\;\\mathrm{mm}$ scenarios is narrower than in the $60\\;\\mathrm{mm}\\times 60\\;\\mathrm{mm}$ scenario. Gratings located at larger or smaller angles cannot be tangential because they have to be rotated to match the blaze angle specification. Thus, they deviate more from the surface of the torus, leading to wider LSFs (lower $R$). Thus, these simulations show that a higher $R$ can be achieved if only certain parts of the aperture are filled with gratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "A second effect is the shift in the peak of the LSF between the green line and the other angles' ranges. This is due to our naive way of placing the gratings. Photons that pass the grating \"outside\" the Rowland torus travel further after they are diffracted and thus are detected at larger dispersion coordinates. Conversely, photons intersecting the grating \"inside\" the Rowland torus are detected at a smaller dispersion coordinate. At some locations, the gratings are mostly tangential to the Rowland torus, which means that almost the entire grating surface sits \"outside\" and thus photons are systematically send to larger dispersion coordinates; in other locations, half of the grating sits \"inside\". These shifts can be corrected by optimizing the grating position to reduce the average deviation from the Rowland torus and we will study this effect in more detail in future work. In our current simulations this is not done and thus the $R$ we derive is a lower bound to the value one would see with optimized grating placement. For example, for a simulation that covers the range in angles e.g.\\ $30-120^\\circ$ in the $60\\;\\mathrm{mm}\\times 60\\;\\mathrm{mm}$ scenario, we would see the combined LSF from adding the orange, green, and red curve, which is wider than it would be for an optimized grating placement that effectively shifts all three curves to have the same peak before adding them up.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now compare the different scenarios in the Figure to our baseline of $60\\;\\mathrm{mm}\\times 30\\;\\mathrm{mm}$ gratings. Simply using larger gratings reduces $R$ as can be seen from comparing $60\\;\\mathrm{mm}\\times 30\\;\\mathrm{mm}$ to the $60\\;\\mathrm{mm}\\times 60\\;\\mathrm{mm}$. However, with a relatively simple chirp applied, even much larger gratings such as  $80\\;\\mathrm{mm}\\times 160\\;\\mathrm{mm}$ can recover the best $R$ seen in the baseline case. With a chirp, essentially the same $R$ is observed for any grating position. If the entire aperture does not have to be filled with gratings, the grating locations can be chosen based on engineering constraints without compromising $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two scenarios $60\\;\\mathrm{mm}\\times 30\\;\\mathrm{mm}$ and $60\\;\\mathrm{mm}\\times 30\\;\\mathrm{mm}$ (scatter) use the same grating locations, but differ in the scatter properties of the mirror. If the mirror PSF is dominated by figure errors and scattering, then sub-aperturing will increase $R$ a lot more than in the scenario where the PSF is dominated by off-center errors.\n"

As shown in the fish-shaped plot above, the width in the y direction changes with order. Again, this plot ignores the photons cross-dispersed by the L1 grating support bars. Using a the same scaling in y direction for all orders in a row would hide several of the details for the PSFs I'm going to discuss now, but keep in mind that the scaling of x and y axis is not the same.

Looking at the zeroth order for any energy, all the colors are well mixed . At 0.4 keV most of the photons are found in order -3 and -4. In both cases, we see that sub-aperturing as discussed in detail above (selecting the angles for cyan, green, and yellow) would narrow the order and thus improve the spectral resolving power. It is interesting to note that the color scheme seems flipped between order -3 and -4. In order -3 the blue-ish photons are found on the top and the reddish photons at the bottom, in order -4 that is reversed. The Rowland torus optimizes the focussing in the dispersion direction, but the focus in the cross-dispersion direction is different. In one case the detector is located below the focus in cross-dispersion direction (so in y direction photons have passed through the focus and spread out again), in the other case it is above the cross-dispersion focus.

When calculating the average, different orders are weighted according to the number of photons they receive.

Nevertheless, it's illustrative to see how sub-aperturing impacts $R$:\n",

Pt-coated gratings are studied separately in a different analysis."

The resolving power is essentially constant with wavelength, because, given the known PSF and grating period $d$, the most important parameter for the resolving power is the distance of the order from the zeroth order. In CAT gratings, most photons are diffracted into the blaze peak, and are thus found at the same phyical location; photons at longer wavelength simply end up at lower diffraction order $n$ but same diffraction angle $theta$: $n \\lambda = d \\sin\\theta$.\n",
